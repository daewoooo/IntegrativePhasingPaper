To install all dependencies, we recommend [Conda](http://anaconda.org). If you don't yet use conda, it is usually easiest to just install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html),  see [instructions](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html).

Then, create and activate an environment that has all required packages installed (where ``environment.yml`` is the file we provide here.

```
conda create --name integrative-phasing -f environment.yml
source activate integrative-phasing
```

TODO: Complete the instructions
